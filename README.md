## âœ¨ **Overview**

Welcome to **Three.js Blackhole** â€” a project that simulates a **real-time blackhole ray tracer** with an accretion disk.  
Inspired by the works of [Rantonels](http://rantonels.github.io/starless/) and [oseiskar](https://github.com/oseiskar/black-hole), this project combines **physics** and **graphics** to create a visually stunning and scientifically accurate experience.

I was captivated by the concept of ray tracing blackholes with a glowing accretion disk, so I embarked on this journey to bring it to life.
