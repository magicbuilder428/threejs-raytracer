### **Overview**

This project is my attempt at creating a **real-time blackhole ray tracer** with an accretion disk, inspired by the works of [Rantonels](http://rantonels.github.io/starless/) and [oseiskar](https://github.com/oseiskar/black-hole). 

I was fascinated by the concept of ray tracing blackholes, especially with the now-popularized accretion disk visuals. This project is my deep dive into understanding and implementing the physics and graphics behind such a phenomenon.
